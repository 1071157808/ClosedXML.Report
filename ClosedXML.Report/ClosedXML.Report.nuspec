    <description>Excel is an excellent alternative to common report generators, and using Excel’s built-in features can make your reports much more responsive. Use ClosedXML.Report as a tool for generating files of Excel. Then use Excel visual instruments: formatting (including conditional formatting), AutoFilter, Pivot tables to construct a versatile data analysis system. With ClosedXML.Report, you can move a lot of report programming and tuning into Excel. ClosedXML.Report templates are simple and our algorithms are fast – we carefully count every millisecond – so you waste less time on routine report programming and get surprisingly fast results. If you want to master such a versatile tool as Excel – ClosedXML.Report is an excellent choice. Furthermore, ClosedXML.Report doesn’t operate with the usual concepts of band-oriented report tools: Footer, Header, and Detail. So you get a much greater degree of freedom in report construction and design, and the easiest possible integration of .NET and Microsoft Excel.</description>
